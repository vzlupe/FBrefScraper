# FBrefScraper

Simple web scrape project to collect player data from www.fbref.com for the big 5 men's leagues

Based on: https://smehta.medium.com/scrape-and-create-your-own-beautiful-dataset-from-sports-reference-com-using-beautifulsoup-python-c26d6920684e

Run FBrefMaster.py to collect from all 5 leagues or create your own file to run a particular league. Code currently does not run 'Big 5' urls. Be sure you have the appropriate folders in the same directory as FBrefMaster.py. Each league takes ~30min. to run.
