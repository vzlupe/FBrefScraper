# FBrefScraper

Simple web scrape project to collect player data from www.fbref.com for the big 5 men's leagues

Based on: https://smehta.medium.com/scrape-and-create-your-own-beautiful-dataset-from-sports-reference-com-using-beautifulsoup-python-c26d6920684e

Run FBrefMaster.py to collect from all 5 leagues or create your own file to run a particular league. Be sure you have the appropriate CSV destination folders in the same directory as FBrefMaster.py. Each league takes ~30min. to run.

Code currently does not run 'Big 5' (see FBrefScrape/FBrefBig5.py) but feel free to get it running. I haven't had the time to work out some issues specific to that dataset.
